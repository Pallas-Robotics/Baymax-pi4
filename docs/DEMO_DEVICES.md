# Orange Pi boards: one feature set

| | Orange Pi 4 Pro | Orange Pi 5 Max |
|---|---|---|
| SoC / CPU | Allwinner A733: 2x Cortex-A76 + 6x Cortex-A55, ARM64 | Rockchip RK3588: 4x Cortex-A76 + 4x Cortex-A55, ARM64 |
| OS | DietPi (Debian 13) SD image from [OPI4-Flash](../devops/opi4-flash/README.md), or Debian 13 | Armbian Debian 13, vendor 6.1 kernel for the NPU; desktop for Setup/Monitor |
| Setup | the SD image, or `Baymax-main/MVP.md` | a git checkout of `release`, clickables and `Baymax-main/ORANGE_PI_SETUP.md` |
| Dependencies | `requirements-orange-pi.txt` | the same file |
| NPU for pose | none: MediaPipe on the CPU | optional: the RK3588 NPU after `features/pose`'s conversion and on-board check; MediaPipe on the CPU otherwise |
| Fast-core pinning, `BAYMAX_CPU_PINNING=auto` | not pinned (unmeasured; `on` tries the 2 A76s) | pinned to cpu4-7 (measured) |
| Wi-Fi provisioning | the image's preset network; open setup hotspot whenever offline, enabled in the image (`deploy/host`) | the OS's own network setup; the same hotspot, installed by 0 - Debian Prerequisites (`deploy/host`, NetworkManager; tested) |
| Eye connection | external Firmata-compatible Arduino; set its real serial path | the same |
| Updates | the image's `ember-update` (branch, default `release`) | opt-in: `devops/mvp/update.py` before each start of the autostart service (git checkout, `install_autostart.py`, `BAYMAX_AUTO_UPDATE=1`; `BAYMAX_UPDATE_BRANCH`, default `release`); otherwise `git pull` by hand |

Both start `Baymax-main/run_mvp.py` -> `run_pc.py` -> `realtime_gemini_10.py` (the
4 Pro image's service, the autostart service, and **3 - Start Ember** on Linux ARM64) and
include the same conversation/personality, Gemini session (reconnecting after any
disconnect), audio cleanup, 400 ms turn-end default, reply-time echo protection, a
voice volume the person can change by asking, local eye expressions, 60-second idle
sleep eyes, engage/disengage, reminders/repeats/check-ins, gentle daily check-ins,
audiobooks/wake recognition, live radio and Internet Archive recordings, brain games,
"look closely" (one sharper camera still on request), app integration, public tools,
conversation memory (saved while Ember runs) and built-in pose/fall detection.
Existing feature flags, opt-ins and saved settings still apply; app integration needs
its device key and alerts need their recipients. Memory Palace/people-recognition work
outside this MVP is not added.

The same code runs on both boards; the board decides at runtime:

- **Pose** runs in its own process (`features/vision_process.py`, so it cannot hold
  Ember's GIL) at 10 fps with `camera.pose_model` (lite by default). On an Orange Pi
  5 Max that passed the NPU check, lite or full means the checked full model on the
  NPU; heavy always stays on the CPU. Everywhere else it is MediaPipe on the CPU. A
  pose process that cannot start or dies is started again once, on the CPU; video
  continues either way.
- **Pinning:** `auto` pins only on the RK3588. Child processes (pose, face) inherit
  it, which on the 4 Pro would leave Ember and both children on its 2 A76 cores, so
  that is left off until measured.
- **The camera** keeps one buffered frame on Linux ARM64 (unmeasured on both boards).
- **rknn-toolkit-lite2** installs on both boards (same requirements file) but is
  imported only on an RK3588 with converted, checked models.

This repository deliberately diverges from JoeKojima/Baymax's `startup-greeting`
(LattePanda) branch: it carries the Orange Pi 5 Max work (NPU pose, pinning, memory on
the board, the per-platform updater) and the Orange Pi 4 Pro image builder. Fixes that
both need are ported by hand in each direction; keep board differences in
`pc_hardware.py`, `features/pose`, the dependency profile, docs and deployment files.

## Setup

Orange Pi 4 Pro: build an SD image with [OPI4-Flash](../devops/opi4-flash/README.md),
or follow `Baymax-main/MVP.md`. Orange Pi 5 Max: follow
`Baymax-main/ORANGE_PI_SETUP.md` (clickables; the NPU steps are optional). Setup
detects Linux ARM64 and installs `requirements-orange-pi.txt` under Python 3.12. It
includes pywebrtc-audio (audio cleanup), pyfirmata2 (eyes), miniaudio (audiobook,
radio and recording decoding), Vosk (offline wake), ChromaDB/ONNX Runtime/tokenizers
(memory) and rknn-toolkit-lite2. ARM miniaudio and praat-parselmouth may compile
from source (the SD image downloads prebuilt wheels instead); install compiler tools.
ARM MediaPipe/NumPy pins differ from x86 pins.

The prerequisite helper supports Debian 13 only. On DietPi/another Debian
version, provision equivalent system libraries first: curl, ca-certificates, git,
libportaudio2, libgl1, libegl1, libgles2, libglib2.0-0 (or the distro's t64
variant), libsndfile1, libasound2-plugins, build-essential, cmake, pkg-config,
and xdg-utils; a browser/terminal and working desktop audio for Setup/Monitor.
Kernel/audio-server provisioning is separate work; the SD image covers it for the
Orange Pi 4 Pro. The root-owned single-radio hotspot service is for the Orange Pi
boards only (ifupdown on the 4 Pro, NetworkManager on the 5 Max), never an x86 robot; the
image and 0 - Debian Prerequisites install it.

Save the actual microphone, speaker and camera in Setup. Never copy another
robot's `.env`, API/device keys or `/etc/ember/device.toml`. Confirm the local
clock/timezone (`timedatectl`; `sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York`,
then restart Ember): check-ins and reminders follow it, and an OPI4-Flash card is
set to `America/Los_Angeles` unless its image settings name another `timezone`.
Stop the older runtime/eye demo before launching this one.
Connect a Firmata-compatible Arduino with the documented MAX7219 wiring and set
`BAYMAX_EYES_PORT` to its actual `/dev/serial/by-id/...` path; the LattePanda
Leonardo default is not an Orange Pi port. Grant the desktop user serial access
(usually `dialout`, followed by logging in again).

For voice sleep, keep audio enhancement healthy and allow the first Vosk model
download (or prefetch with `.venv/bin/python features/toolkits/wakeword.py --download`
from `Baymax-main`). Missing cleanup or wake recognition refuses/undoes sleep.
Disengage withholds Gemini-bound microphone audio; camera frames and existing
raw local recordings continue. This is voice sleep, not a privacy-off switch.

## Validation

Run `python check_release.py` in `Baymax-main`; preserve separate core/toolkit
results. The profile test checks the shared feature dependencies and the installer
architecture selection. Pull requests also run the checks with
`requirements-orange-pi.txt` on GitHub's Linux ARM64 runner
(`.github/workflows/offline-checks.yml`): same pins and CPU architecture, not an
Orange Pi. Offline checks do not establish physical equivalence between the boards.

On each board, verify installation/native imports, selected devices, audible
multi-turn conversation/echo, engage/disengage (including reminder/fall wake),
eyes, audiobook, radio and recording playback (and that a fall check-in or due
reminder pauses it), the voice volume on the board's speaker, "look closely" with the
board's camera, daily check-ins on the board's clock, reconnecting after a Wi-Fi drop,
reminders/app integration, memory, fall behavior,
sustained camera+audio performance (CPU summed over Ember and its pose/face
processes), clean stop/restart and cold boot. On the Orange Pi 5 Max also the NPU
path inside Ember; on both boards the hotspot (if installed); on the Orange Pi 4 Pro the SD
image's first boot and updates. Hardware/provider checks remain pending; no device,
service, saved SD image or production alert is changed by preparing this
repository. Software-lead review remains required for release.
